=======================================


Seaborn like image data visualization using matplotlib, scikit-image and scipy.


Description
===========

Seaborn-image is a seaborn like python **image** visualization library based on matplotlib.
The aim of seaborn-image is to provide a high-level API to **plot attractive images quickly**
with addons such as scalebar, title, colorbars, etc. with a single line of code.


.. code-block:: python
    import seaborn_image as isns

    isns.imgplot(data)

Note
====

This project was started because I was looking for a seaborn like library for images but couldn't find any.
